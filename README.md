Heyo! Thanks for using my Tiktok api.
As of right now I dont have a setup tutorial to guide you through the process of setting up these files.
Please run setup.bat to install the required libraries.
Also, do NOT delete "chromedriver.exe" It is for allowing python to communicate with google to get the follower count and bio.
I will release patches and updates as Tiktok's html layout changes.
Please credit me when using my api in your games. Placing "TikTok API made by Cryptic_Here" on the sign in gui would be fine. But please do not remove credit.

PORT FORWARDING IS A MUST!!!! PLEASE FORWARD PORT 8000 ON TCP/UDP IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PORT FORWARD THIS IS A GREAT TUTORIAL TO GET YOU STARTED :

(if you can't find your default gateway address, it is usually 192.168.1.1 or 10.0.0.1 but can vary)



If you do use this API in a game or need help, please DM me at cryptic#6201 on Discord.

Once again, thanks for using my API.
